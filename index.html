Here she is; Z√ºhre Vardak from Afghanistan. She started her school in Afghan Turk Girls High School in 2007 ad and has graduated from school in 2012. Then, she has got the Kankor exam (entrance exam of university) and passed it successfully all by her personal and their Turkish trainers‚Äô efforts. She has started her university life by entering the science Faculty (Biology) of KABUL UNIVERSITY in 2013 ad. Besides that, it was actually the start of her job life. It means that she has been introduced to Afghan Turk Omid Educational Center (ATOEC) as trainer and mentor. She has learnt a lot of things during her job; furthermore, she has taught the real path of living to her students. Since 2013 up to now she has been working for Humanitarian on the way of reaching Allah. Moreover, she has been teaching her students kindness and goodness, living elastically, being hopeful and strong in their life on the way of reaching their goals that Allah (SWT) has given them on the first day of the world. Z√ºhre Vardak has taught her trainees to fly just like an Albatross on the surface of the big and terrible ocean of the world. Therefore, all the students of Z√ºhre Vardak are really grateful to her for such hardworking. They all appreciate Z√ºhre Vardak not only for just being thier teacher but also thier hero, abla and angel. Now, who are we? We are those girls that are really grateful to Z√ºhre Vardak for changing thier life from left to right. We are those students of Afghan Turk Omid Educational Center (ATOEC) who learnt how to worship the God of the universe and how to be a good servant to thier Allah and thier community, how to write the book of thier life by themselves and fly like birds. We are publishing and presenting this webpage as a small gift in front of her efforts for us. We want form Z√ºhre Vardak just to know how much she is valuable and what a sweet experience she put behind her for us!
